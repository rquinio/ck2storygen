# Crusader Kings 2 Alternate History Generator

This repository is a mirror of the sources provided by yemmlie101 for his tool _Out of Africa: Crusader Kings 2 Alternate History Generator_.

It generates, from scratch, a completely new history of humanity from its first exodus from Africa, as a new mod to be playable in CK2.

A random culture and pagan religion is formed, using all the parameters available for religions and cultures in CK2, as well as forming a unique language used to name characters, provinces, kingdoms, gods, religions. 

These cultures will then spread throughout europe, mutating and changing as they spread, words and language, religions, ethnicity, cultural ideals, laws, looting, river sailing, incest, religious heads, holy sites, wives, concubines and everything, all morphing, mutating and branching off as humans spread through time and land, and form a completely unique world with absolutely none of the vanilla cultures, religions, provinces, de-jure duchies or anything found in the base game. 

Absolutely everything about the history of the world (except the map data itself) is unique.
